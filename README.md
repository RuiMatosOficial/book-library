# Book Library API

Simply a demo application built using Expressive that I use in my talks.

Requires PHP 7.2+ and a PostgreSQL server.

## Usage

```bash
$ git clone git@github.com:asgrim/book-library.git
$ cd book-library
$ cp config/autoload/local.php.dist config/autoload/local.php
# Then modify local.php to your needs!
$ composer install
$ composer serve
```

Then visit [localhost:8080](http://localhost:8080/).
